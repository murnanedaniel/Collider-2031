## Critical Inflection Points

1. **June 2026** - Dr. Marcus Reed's viral TED talk
   - Without this: less public pressure for open science
   - Probability: 30% (already a great communicator)

2. **March 2027** - Swiss Federal Data Transparency Act
   - Without this: status quo continues, data remains siloed
   - Probability: 20% (requires specific political alignment, but Reed's talk helps)

3. **June 2028** - Novak/Apex AI CEO conversation
   - Without this: compute remains bottleneck, slows everything
   - Probability: 5% (serendipitous, personality-dependent, alcohol-assisted)

4. **2029** - Geant5 v1.0 fully differentiable
   - Without this: no SM surface mapping, limited anomaly detection
   - Probability: 60% (clear technical roadmap, but challenging)

5. **June 2030** - HL-LHC starts successfully
   - Without this: everything delays
   - Probability: 95% (already committed, hardware being installed)

6. **2030** - Foundation Space SM surface mapping
   - Without this: no automated anomaly detection paradigm
   - Probability: 40% (depends on Geant5 + sufficient compute + convergence)

7. **Overall probability of this timeline by 2031**: ~0.2% (requires multiple low-probability events aligning)

## Alternative Scenarios

### Pessimistic Timeline (More Likely: ~30%)
- Data mandate delayed or watered down
- Geant5 arrives 2032, limited differentiability
- Mistral doesn't commit compute (no drunk conversation)
- Compute remains scarce, rationed by committees
- HL-LHC starts 2030 but infrastructure not ready
- Maja would need institutional backing and years to pursue her idea
- Discovery still possible but would take years, not hours

### Optimistic Timeline (Less Likely: <1%)
- Multiple governments mandate open data (2026-2027)
- Multiple tech companies contribute compute
- Geant5 arrives 2029, exceeds expectations
- Foundation Space reaches near-AGI physics understanding
- Automated discovery without human insight needed
- By 2031, most physics done by AI agents

### Realistic Middle Ground (~40%)
- Gradual opening of data over 2026-2035
- Incremental compute improvements
- Geant5 by 2031-2032 with partial differentiability
- Foundation models useful but not revolutionary
- Collaborative structure evolves slowly
- HL-LHC performs well but infrastructure lags
- Maja-like discoveries possible by 2040

## Turning Points That Could Derail This Timeline

**Before 2027:**

- Swiss government reverses data mandate after pushback
- Mistral CEO changes, commitment withdrawn
- Geant5 proves infeasible technically

- HL-LHC construction problems → further delays

**2029-2031 (HL-LHC Year 0-1):**
- Credit economy exploited, collapses
- Foundation Space overfits, produces only false signals
- HL-LHC performance below expectations
- Major detector damage from high luminosity
- Maja's generation disengaged from physics

   - Racing for discovery → shared anomaly investigation
   - Hoarding data → contributing to commons
   - Individual glory → collective progress
